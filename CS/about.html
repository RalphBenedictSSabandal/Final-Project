            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>Our project began with a small group of 5. We'd each go to local houses around the neighborhood and try to convince people to subscribe 
                to our cheap service. We went through problems raising funds in the beginning, however many kind people gave life to the project through
                very generous donations. It began with the idea to promote and implement recycling all around the world, and we're still going. From 5 people,
                RecyCom has grown to around 200,000 personnel. We have been, and always will be a non-profit organization that aims to promote recycling to 
                everyone in the world, and now, you can join us too.
