    <p class="intro">We're a non-profit organization seeking to promote recycling and reduce global waste. We provide a 
      trash collecting service that recycles your trash with no extra fees at the same cost as average waste
      collecting services. The major difference? You receive refunds when you contribute enough to the service.

    <p class="para">According to <a style="color: greenyellow;" href="https://www.unep.org/resources/global-waste-management-outlook-2024">UNEP's Global Waste Management Outlook 2024</a> 
      "Municipal solid waste generation is predicted to grow from 2.1 billion tonnes in 2023 to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050.
      In 2020, the global direct cost of waste management was an estimated USD 252 billion."
    </p>
    <p class="para">We aim to work towards a world with less waste production. Waste can be reduced by simply recycling or reusing products. Our service works
      towards recycling waste from all around the world. So far we've extended our reach through all of Asia, Europe, and some of Africa. With
      your help we could extend our reach throughout the entire world, promoting recycling and lessening waste production along the way. 
    </p>
    <p class="para">This is why you can help not only the world but also yourself and your family by <a style="color: greenyellow;"" href="sub.html">subscribing</a> to our service. 
      You can even save money because of our refund feature. Simply contribute enough trash and our service is completely free.
      We hope you contribute to this cause that millions around the world are working towards, and you can join too.
